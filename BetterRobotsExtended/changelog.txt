Version: 1.1.16
Date: 07.12.25

    - base recipe requirements used for comparison against vanilla robot recipes.

Version: 1.1.15
Date: 07.12.25
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed BRE roboport MK2/MK3 charging robots even when not connected to the power grid. Their energy source now correctly starts empty and requires power before charging any bots.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.14
Date: 06.12.25
  Changes:
    - Unified MK1 recipe loading to prevent duplicate registration and improve stability.
    - Added safety check preventing MK1 generation when base recipes remain unmodified (unless forced through mod setting).
  Modding:
    - Improved recipe detection system to correctly identify modified construction-robot and logistic-robot base recipes when used with Bob’s Mods and other overhauls.
    - MK1 robot recipes are now generated only after final data stage to ensure full compatibility with mods that patch vanilla robots in data-updates and data-final-fixes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.13
Date: 21.09.25 
  Bugfixes:

Version: 1.1.8
Date: 2025-01-29
  Features:
    - New setting "Disables Bobs bots" Disables Bob's bots and Roboports along with their associated research.
    - New setting "Forces a recipe for MK1 bots" Adds an additional recipe for MK1 bots and Roboports based on base-game specifications and places them in the regular category.
    - If "Forces a recipe for MK1 bots" is enabled, a second recipe for logistic-robot, construction-robot, and Roboports is added based on base-game specifications, as the original recipes from Bob's Mods are altered and cannot be easily reverted.
    - If "Forces a recipe for MK1 bots" is enabled, the recipes for MK1 bots and Roboports are unlocked through research.
    - Fixed the order of logistic bots and construction bots, and Roboports so that MK1 appears first, followed by MK2, MK3, MK4, and MK5.
